# ToDoList

## Introduction
✨ A simple To-do List created by yours truly <br>
✨ Split your Work and Home list so you don't mix them up <br>
✨ This was created to explore the concepts of Node.js, Express.js, EJS, MongoDB <br>

## Deployed on Heroku
✨ Check out my app on Heroku: https://secret-dawn-11631.herokuapp.com/ <br>
✨ Add /work or /home to make different lists <br>

## Future Improvements
What I hope to do ...<br>
✨ Let users register/ sign in, either by typing in email and password, or signing in using Google and Facebook<br>
✨ Each user can have their own To-do list
